	- poll TMS object API endpoint, and get the correlating component include
	- make directory named with component number --- component id --- object id (get from file name)

- run fiwalk on disk image to get DFXML
- parse DPX CSV to find dir names of components
- search DFXML for files that include these folder names in their paths
â€“ grab the MD5
- write "data/"+[ filename path from DFXML ], a tab space, and then the MD5 (one line per file)
